# Festival-website
This project is a static, multi-page festival website developed using HTML5 and CSS3. It highlights three major Indian festivals—Onam, Lohri, and Makar Sankranti—through structured layouts, modern styling, and responsive design. The website focuses on clean UI, cultural representation, and smooth visual presentation using pure frontend technologies
